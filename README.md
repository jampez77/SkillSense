SkillSense sits *beside* Claude Code and OpenAI Codex — it never replaces them — and quietly
reminds them what you've already installed, right before they process each prompt.

## What it does

Before your prompt reaches Claude Code or Codex, SkillSense:

1. **Looks up** your locally indexed skills, commands, agents, MCP servers, project rules, and
   instruction files.
2. **Scores** them against your prompt with a fast, local, deterministic matcher — no LLM, no
   network call.
3. **Injects** a short, factual note naming the relevant capability, why it matched, and where it
   lives — but only when something scores highly enough.
4. **Stays silent** otherwise. No noise, no nagging.

<br>

## At a glance

The injected nudge is deliberately a single line — just enough for the agent to act on, nothing
more. It also skips the capability's name entirely when it's already obvious from the path (a
`SKILL.md` whose parent directory *is* the name), and only spells it out when it isn't — e.g. an
MCP server living in a shared `.mcp.json`, or a skill whose frontmatter name doesn't match its
directory. When exactly one capability matches:

```text
You ask:
  "Can you help fix this Home Assistant config flow? The login appears to have
   failed, probably transient, refreshing the integration fixes it."

SkillSense quietly adds:
  SkillSense: relevant installed capability — ~/.codex/skills/home-assistant-integration-debugging
```

When more than one capability matches, SkillSense doesn't guess on your behalf — it hands the
choice to you (name shown only where the path alone wouldn't be enough):

```text
SkillSense quietly adds:
  SkillSense: multiple relevant capabilities installed — ask the user which to use:
  ~/.claude/skills/flutter-performance-review,
  android-profiler-checklist (~/Development/shared-skills/android-profiler)
```

Either way it's one line, and it's silent when nothing matches well.

<br>

## Why it exists

As you install more skills, commands, agents, and MCP servers, you inevitably forget what's
already there. The common failure mode:

```
you ask the agent to do a task
  └─ a relevant installed skill already exists
       └─ the agent doesn't select it
            └─ you get a weaker answer, or reinvent the workflow by hand
```

The problem isn't skill *execution* — it's skill *recall*. SkillSense answers one question,
automatically, on every prompt:

> **"Before this prompt is processed, are there any installed capabilities that appear materially
> relevant?"**

<br>

## How it works

SkillSense hooks into each platform's `UserPromptSubmit` lifecycle event:

```text
prompt submitted
  → UserPromptSubmit hook fires
  → skillsense hook claude|codex reads the payload from stdin
  → scores your local capability index against the prompt (weighted lexical matching, see below)
  → above threshold: prints a short recommendation block
  → below threshold: prints nothing
  → exits 0 either way — a SkillSense failure can never block your prompt
```

Matching is entirely local and deterministic: name/tag/keyword overlap, BM25 over descriptions,
and example-prompt similarity, combined into a single 0–1 score. See
[`packages/core/src/matcher/score.ts`](packages/core/src/matcher/score.ts) for the exact formula.
No LLM, no embeddings, no API key, in this version.

## Supported agents

| Agent | Integration |
| --- | --- |
| **Claude Code** | Plugin hook — [`plugins/claude/skillsense`](plugins/claude/skillsense) |
| **OpenAI Codex** | Plugin hook — [`plugins/codex/skillsense`](plugins/codex/skillsense) |

---

## Installation

Requires **Node.js 22.5+** (24+ recommended). SkillSense uses Node's built-in `node:sqlite`
module for local storage — no native compilation, no extra runtime dependency.

```bash
git clone <this repo>
cd skillsense
npm install
npm run build
cd packages/cli
npm link          # puts `skillsense` on your PATH
skillsense --version
```

<br>

## Quick start

```bash
skillsense scan                          # index your installed capabilities
skillsense list                          # see what got indexed
skillsense search "debug flutter jank"   # manually test the matcher
skillsense doctor                        # check the install is healthy
```

<br>

## Claude Code setup

1. Make sure `skillsense` is on your `PATH` (see [Installation](#installation)) and you've run
   `skillsense scan` at least once.
2. Install the plugin at `plugins/claude/skillsense` into Claude Code. See
   [`plugins/claude/skillsense/README.md`](plugins/claude/skillsense/README.md) for details,
   including how to register it as a local dev marketplace for testing.
3. Run `skillsense doctor` to confirm the hook is wired up.

<br>

## Codex setup

1. Same PATH + `skillsense scan` prerequisite as above.
2. Install the plugin at `plugins/codex/skillsense`. Codex requires you to explicitly **trust**
   any hook (including plugin-bundled ones) before it runs — run `/hooks` in the Codex CLI after
   installing. Full details in
   [`plugins/codex/skillsense/README.md`](plugins/codex/skillsense/README.md).

---

## Configuration

Config lives at `~/.config/skillsense/config.yaml` (or `SKILLSENSE_CONFIG` to override the path).
Defaults:

```yaml
version: 1
scanPaths: []            # extra directories to scan, in addition to the built-in locations below
minScore: 0.75
maxRecommendations: 3    # hard cap is 5 regardless of this value
includePathsInOutput: true
outputPathMode: relative # full | relative | hidden
autoScan:
  enabled: true
  maxAgeMinutes: 60      # currently informational only — see "Auto-scan" below
matching:
  useEmbeddings: false   # not implemented in this version, reserved for future use
  useKeywordMatching: true
  useFuzzyMatching: true
privacy:
  allowCloudMetadataGeneration: false
  allowCloudEmbeddings: false
logging:
  level: warn
  logPromptText: false
```

Manage it via the CLI instead of hand-editing:

```bash
skillsense config get
skillsense config get minScore
skillsense config set maxRecommendations 3
skillsense config add-path ~/Development/shared-ai-skills
```

### Built-in scan locations

SkillSense always scans these, relative to both your home directory and the current project
(`scanPaths` in config adds *extra* locations on top of these):

| | Locations |
| --- | --- |
| **Claude** | `.claude/skills/**/SKILL.md`, `.claude/commands/**/*.md`, `.claude/rules/**/*.md`, `CLAUDE.md` |
| **Codex** | `.codex/skills/**/SKILL.md`, `.codex/plugins/**/SKILL.md`, `.codex/config.toml` (MCP servers), `.codex/hooks.json`, `AGENTS.md` |
| **Generic** | `.cursor/rules/**/*.md`, `.github/prompts/**/*.md`, `.ai/**/*.md`, `.llm/**/*.md`, `.llmpress/**/*.md`, `docs/ai/**/*.md`, `.mcp.json` |

### Auto-scan

The hook itself **never** triggers a scan — this keeps every hook invocation fast and predictable
(no risk of a slow filesystem walk blocking your prompt). Run `skillsense scan` whenever your
capabilities change; `skillsense doctor` reports how stale the index is.

---

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `skillsense scan [--path <dir>] [--verbose] [--json]` | Build/update the index |
| `skillsense list [--source <s>] [--type <t>] [--json]` | List indexed capabilities |
| `skillsense search "<prompt>" [--json]` | Manually score capabilities against a prompt (debug tool, ignores thresholds) |
| `skillsense explain <capability> "<prompt>"` | Explain why a specific capability did/didn't match |
| `skillsense hook claude` / `skillsense hook codex` | Hook adapters — read a lifecycle payload from stdin, emit platform-appropriate context |
| `skillsense doctor` | Validate the install (index, hooks, PATH, config) |
| `skillsense config get\|set\|add-path` | View/update config |

---

## Privacy

- **Local-first, no network calls by default.** Scanning, indexing, and matching all run on your
  machine.
- **No prompts or capability contents are ever uploaded** unless you explicitly enable a cloud
  feature (none exist in this version — `privacy.allowCloudMetadataGeneration` and
  `privacy.allowCloudEmbeddings` are placeholders for future opt-in features and default to
  `false`).
- **Read-only scanning.** SkillSense never executes a discovered skill or script, and never
  parses `.env` files or other secret stores.
- **Minimal hook output, always.** Injected context is a single line — a capability's name and
  (optionally) its path, nothing else — never full file contents, and never a type/source/reason
  breakdown. Set `outputPathMode: hidden` or `includePathsInOutput: false` to drop the path too.
- **Prompts aren't logged by default.** `logging.logPromptText: false` is the default; only a
  short hash of the prompt is recorded against `usage_events` for future analytics.
- **Fail open, always.** Any internal error in a hook — bad input, missing index, a parser bug —
  results in silent exit 0. SkillSense can never be the reason your prompt didn't go through.

---

## Troubleshooting

Run `skillsense doctor` first — it checks the database, index size, config file, PATH, and
whether it can find hook references for Claude/Codex, then actually executes both hook
subcommands to confirm they exit cleanly.

<br>

**Hook produces no output, ever**
- Confirm `skillsense scan` has been run and `skillsense list` shows capabilities.
- Try `skillsense search "<your prompt>"` directly — if the score is well under 0.60, that's
  expected: SkillSense is intentionally conservative (high precision over recall, see
  `minScore`/`maxRecommendations` in config).
- Set `SKILLSENSE_DEBUG=1` and check the log file (`~/Library/Logs/skillsense/skillsense.log` on
  macOS, `~/.local/state/skillsense/skillsense.log` elsewhere) — hook internals never write to
  stdout, so this is the only place to see what happened.

**`skillsense: command not found` in the plugin hook**
- The plugin calls the global `skillsense` binary, not a bundled copy. Re-run `npm link` (or
  `npm install -g .`) from `packages/cli`, and confirm with `which skillsense`.

**Codex hook never fires**
- Codex requires explicit hook trust. Run `/hooks` in the Codex CLI and trust the
  `skillsense hook codex` entry.

**A capability isn't being picked up by `scan`**
- Check it's under one of the [built-in scan locations](#built-in-scan-locations), or add its
  directory via `skillsense config add-path`.
- Files over 512KB are skipped as a safety guard against indexing large binaries.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build       # builds packages/core (tsc) and packages/cli (tsup)
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test            # vitest: unit + integration + performance tests
```

Monorepo layout:

```text
packages/core   — pure library: scanner, parsers, indexer, matcher, ranker, formatter, storage, config
packages/cli    — the `skillsense` command-line tool
plugins/claude  — Claude Code plugin (hook + docs)
plugins/codex   — Codex plugin (hook + docs)
tests/          — fixtures + integration/performance tests
examples/       — sample UserPromptSubmit payloads for both platforms
```

## Roadmap

Deliberately out of scope for this version (see the project brief, section 28, for the full
rationale): semantic/embedding-based matching, learning from acceptance/dismissal signals, an
interactive "use this skill?" prompt mode, skill health checks (duplicates, staleness), exposing
SkillSense as an MCP server, and a VS Code extension. The architecture (in particular, the
`skillsense-core` package having zero Claude/Codex-specific logic) is intended to make these
additive later without a rewrite.
